# Introduction

## Linear regression overview

Regression is the predicting or learning of numerical features in statistics and machine learning. This process includes the prediction of numeric as well as categorical attributes. Performing a regression allows for the determination of which factors in situations matter, what is their impact, and how they influence other factors. Regression allows for data driven decisions that eliminate guesswork. ([@Joshi20])

Simple linear regression finds the relationship between a dependent and independent variable whereas multiple linear regression can find the relationship between the dependent and multiple independent variables. ([@Joshi20])

The data is modeled on a graph and a line is fitted to the data. This allows for the determination of the coefficients of the independent variable or variables. ([@Joshi20])

### Regression line fitting

Regression line fitting is a delicate balance as the line should predict the desired value well based on several features but be applicable enough to be used repeatedly with different samples of data. The line should not be underfitted, which would not provide an accurate prediction. The line also should not be overfitted to the sample, which would cause the model not to work well with different samples and the data at large. ([@Jabbar14])

Several methods can be used to ensure appropriate line fitting. We can compare the data to the AUC Curves which allows for determining the curves predictive ability by quantifying it. The higher the AUC the more predictive the model. The data is separated into two parts. 80% of the data is labeled as the training or estimation data and 20% of the data is labeled as the validation set. Both parts of the data are tested to ensure the AUC values are similar.([@Aheto21])

The Penalty Method is important to prevent overfitting. We set $E_{train}$ and $E_{test}$ to be the test error, respectively. We then try to find a the minimal penalty such that $E_{test} = E_{train} + Penalty$ ([@Jabbar14])

Early Stopping Method is used for the prevention of both over and underfitting. The sample data is broken down into three parts: training, validation, and testing. This data is then broken down in to the similar 80%/20% split to estimate the line and then to validate the process. ([@Jabbar14])

### Bias and variance

Bias measures the amount of deviation from the expected value is from the estimator in the models. Variance measures how far the data fluctuates. (Mehta, Bukov, Wang)

If we consider the bulls eye as an example: low bias indicates that the estimators are in th vicinity of the bulls eye and low variance indicates that the estimators are close together like in a cluster. ([@Gudivada17])

## Regularization

Regularization was introduced in the context of dealing with the matrix inverse. This inverse issue caused the answer to live outside the of the needed mathematical space. The introduction of the regularization parameter is a smoothness penalty which allowed the problem to be solved. ([@Bickel06])

The fitting of models with large numbers of parameters also has similar issues in which makes the models unstable. This issue requires the need for regularization to get a sensible model. The LASSO regression also has a penalty to ensure the model is stable and thus works with the data. ([@Bickel06])

Ordinary Least Squares needed improvements due to the issue with large variance even though the process has a low bias. Shrinking or setting the coefficients to zero can improve the accuracy of the predictions. This process can introduce some bias but will reduce the variance which can improve the prediction accuracy. ([@Hastie15])

### LASSO

LASSO or Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator is a regularized regression modeling method that performs variable selection and regularization. These two components allow for better accuracy in prediction and interpretation in the model. ([@Dehmer19]).

In the variable selection side, LASSO regression identifies the proper variables that will minimize prediction error and lessen the computer-intensive nature. Less variables, less computational power is needed. ([@Cook18])

The selection of variables comes from a constraint on the model parameters. This is done by forcing the sum of the absolute value of these coefficients to be less than a fixed value $\lambda$. This constraint lowers the complexity of the model by eliminating variables from the model that are reduced to zero after the shrinkage. ([@Cook18])

This shrinking of some of the coefficients to zero provides for an automated way for doing model selection in linear regression. ([@Hastie15])

$\lambda$ is chosen using an automated k-fold cross-validation approach. This approach is were the data is partitioned into sub-samples of equal size. *k-1* out of *k* sub-samples are used for developing the model with the $k^{th}$ sample used to validate the model. This process is done *k* times to ensure each sub-set *k* is used to validate the model as some point. This process provides a range of values for $\lambda$. This provides a data set that allows for choosing a preferred $\lambda$. ([@Cook18])

LASSO is not perfect. LASSO trades off the potential bias of individual parameter estimates for a better overall prediction. An important disadvantage to note is that the individual regression coefficients may be less reliable to interpret individually. The focus of the LASSO regression is to provide the best combined prediction. ([@Cook18])

### Ridge Regression

Ridge Regression is a regularized regression model that predates the LASSO. ([@Hastie15]) This method also has a shrinking effect on the coefficients of the linear model but does not reduce these coefficients to zero. ([@Dehmer19]). This method can simplify the problem from the original set of coefficients it does not have the added property of automated model selection.

## Feature selection

LASSO, Ridge, and Elastic Net Regression simplify the features by reducing and/or simplifying the values to zero. Due to this type of feature selection and/or reduction, the model may result in poor fitting. ([@Aheto21]) This ill-fitting is mentioned in the previous section on regression line fitting.

Modeling a situation where the number of features is larger than the number of observations is a difficult and unsolved problem in many situations. ([@Laura20])
