More information about this package can be found at (“An Introduction to ‘Glmnet‘” 2021)\nFor this demonstration, the political freedom homicide variable will be the response variable.

In addition, it doesn’t have any residual degrees of freedom, and invalid test scores. The model is not workable due to a lack of degrees of freedom to fit the number of predictors in the data set. In this case, the number of predictors could be trimmed at random to get a working model, but the regularization techniques can be used to evaluate this data set without randomly choosing predictors.\nTo fit the regularization models, the glmnet function will be used. The CV.glmnet function below performs a cross-fold validation on the training data in order to obtain the optimal lambda value for the respective model. In this function, the value of alpha controls the form of regularization that will be applied. An alpha value of 1 corresponds to LASSO regression, a value of 0 corresponds to Ridge Regression, and a value in between corresponds to a form of Elastic Net Regularization. The magnitude of alpha controls the penalty term in the Elastic Net Regularization. As in most regularization problems, the value of the penalty term (in this case lambda) is of critical importance.\n\n\n5.0.2 Fitting Regularized Models\nEach method will have a model fit. These will then have their RSquare and RMSE scores displayed to show a relative performance for each method.\nThe basic code structure is as follows:\n\nPerform Cross Validation to acquire the optimal lambda.

The pure LASSO regression shows that 9 predictors (without the intercept term) were selected, while the pure Ridge Regression shows all 98 possible predictors were chosen. The Elastic Net models fall somewhere between, depending on the strength of the alpha parameter.\nThe LASSO selected features included:\n\nprint(LASSOCoef)\n\n                         Predictor           Coefficient\n1                      (Intercept)     0.146490919100984\n2  pf_ss_disappearances_fatalities   -0.0212363595160555\n3             pf_ss_disappearances    -0.913737552722075\n4                      pf_ss_women    -0.955047621110517\n5                            pf_ss      2.85946335709078\n6           pf_religion_harassment   -0.0127804254185799\n7                      pf_religion -0.000370056255707164\n8           pf_expression_internet   -0.0013295634783857\n9                   ef_legal_crime    0.0390520848618338\n10         ef_trade_movement_visit  -0.00249144481920272\n\n\nThe model with the best fit in this case was the pure LASSO model. As has been shown, this regression model can be used for predictions. More refinement can be performed. For example, in this case, there is still the likelihood that the model is overfit since 17 predictors is still a large number when compared to 93 observations. To further understand this is a matter of the underlying mechanics in the data. It is also possible that these 17 predictors still have some manner of collinearity present. Regularization, in this case, has now given a workable group of features to analyze for a refined linear model.\n\n\n\n\n“An Introduction to ‘Glmnet‘.” 2021. https://glmnet.stanford.edu/articles/glmnet.html."

    "text": "Regularized Regression techniques have been used extensively in the available literature, and, interestingly, the application is not strictly limited to the regression problem. For example, the feature selection qualities of the LASSO method have been useful as a preprocessor before applying a machine learning method such as a neural network.\nBecause these methods are well established, there is continuing development on extensions of them in the literature. For example, (Sethi and Mittal 2021) used a method based on LASSO called Correlation based Adaptive LASSO to predict air quality across areas of Delhi, India. This method is actually an “extension of an extension” since Adaptive LASSO is itself based on the original LASSO method. Adaptive LASSO is a LASSO method with oracle properties that utilizes Ridge Regression to help prevent the overfitting of large coefficients that can occur with traditional LASSO. This example demonstrates that regularization methods are a changing field of study."

The idea behind this study was that the concentration of gas is linked to accident rates in coal mines, but there were a large number of features to deal with. The researchers used LASSO to perform feature selection before fitting an ANN with both the complete set and reduced set of features. In this case, the predictors solved the LASSO problem (finding the optimal value of the shrinkage penalty Lambda) using the Least Angle Regression (LARS) algorithm.\n(Aheto et al. 2021) used Regularized Regression to study the prevalence of child malaria in Ghana. In their study, the different dependent variables were unable to be well modeled by other approaches (such as ARIMA and correlation models), so regularization was applied to reduce the number of covariates in the models."

    "text": "Regression is the predicting or learning of numerical features in statistics and machine learning. This process includes the prediction of numeric as well as categorical attributes. Performing a regression allows for the determination of which factors in situations matter, what is their impact, and how they influence other factors. Regression allows for data driven decisions that eliminate guesswork. (Joshi and Saxena 2020)\nSimple linear regression finds the relationship between a dependent and independent variable whereas multiple linear regression can find the relationship between the dependent and multiple independent variables. (Joshi and Saxena 2020)\nThe data is modeled on a graph and a line is fitted to the data. This allows for the calculation of the coefficients of the independent variable or variables. ((Joshi and Saxena 2020))\n\n\nRegression line fitting is a delicate balance as the line should predict the desired value well based on several features but be applicable enough to be used repeatedly with different samples of data. The line should not be under-fitted, which would not provide an accurate prediction. The line also should not be over-fitted to the sample, which would cause the model not to work well with different samples and the data at large. ((Jabbar and Khan 2014))\nSeveral methods can be used to ensure appropriate line fitting. We can compare the data to the AUC Curves which determining the curves predictive ability by quantifying with the Area Under the Curve. The higher the AUC the more predictive the model. The data is separated into two parts. 80% of the data is labeled as the training or estimation data and 20% of the data is labeled as the validation set. Both parts of the data are tested to ensure the AUC values are similar.((Aheto et al. 2021))\nThe penalty method is important to prevent over-fitting. We set \\(E_{train}\\) and \\(E_{test}\\) to be the training set error and test error, respectively. We then try to find a the minimal penalty such that \\(E_{test} = E_{train} + Penalty\\) (Jabbar and Khan 2014)\nThe early stopping method is used for the prevention of both over and under-fitting. The sample data is broken down into three parts: training, validation, and testing. This data is then broken down in to the similar 80%/20% split to estimate the line and then to validate the process. (Jabbar and Khan 2014) ### Bias and variance\nBias measures the amount of deviation from the expected value is from the estimator in the models. Variance measures how far the data fluctuates. (Mehta, Bukov, Wang)\nIf we consider the bulls eye as an example: low bias indicates that the estimators are in the vicinity of the bulls eye and low variance indicates that the estimators are close together like in a cluster.

    "section": "1.2 Regularization",
    "text": "1.2 Regularization\nRegularization was introduced in the context of dealing with the matrix inverse. This inverse issue caused the answer to live outside of the needed mathematical space. The introduction of the regularization parameter is a smoothness penalty which allowed the problem to be solved. (Fan et al. 2006)\nThe fitting of models with large numbers of parameters also has similar issues in which makes the models unstable. This issue requires the need for regularization to get a sensible model. The LASSO regression also has a penalty to ensure the model is stable and thus works with the data. (Fan et al. 2006)\nOrdinary least squares needed improvements due to the issue with large variance even though the process has a low bias. Shrinking or setting the coefficients to zero can improve the accuracy of the predictions. This process can introduce some bias but will reduce the variance which can improve the prediction accuracy. (Hastie and Tibshirani 2015)\n\n1.2.1 LASSO\nLASSO or Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator is a regularized regression modeling method that performs variable selection and regularization. These two components allow for better accuracy in prediction and interpretation in the model. (Emmert-Streib and Dehmer 2019).\nIn the variable selection side, LASSO regression identifies the proper variables that will minimize prediction error and lessen the computer-intensive nature. Less variables mean less computational power is needed. (Ranstam and Cook 2018)\nThe selection of variables comes from a constraint on the model parameters. This is done by forcing the sum of the absolute value of these coefficients to be less than a fixed value \\(\\lambda\\). This constraint lowers the complexity of the model by eliminating variables from the model that are reduced to zero after the shrinkage. (Ranstam and Cook 2018)\nThis shrinking of some of the coefficients to zero provides for an automated way for doing model selection in linear regression. (Hastie and Tibshirani 2015)\n\\(\\lambda\\) is chosen using an automated k-fold cross-validation approach. This approach is were the data is partitioned into sub-samples of equal size. k-1 out of k sub-samples are used for developing the model with the \\(k^{th}\\) sample used to validate the model. This process is done k times to ensure each sub-set k is used to validate the model as some point. This process provides a range of values for \\(\\lambda\\) and provides a data set to determine a preferred \\(\\lambda\\). (Ranstam and Cook 2018)\nLASSO is not perfect. LASSO trades off the potential bias of individual parameter estimates for a better overall prediction. (Ranstam, Cook). This method allows for the determination of a smaller subset of predictors that shows the strongest effects on the model. ((Hastie and Tibshirani 2015)) Important disadvantage to note is that the individual regression coefficients may be less reliable to interpret individually (Ranstam and Cook 2018). Also, LASSO is not capable of selecting more predictors than the number of of observations in the sample.((Emmert-Streib and Dehmer 2019)).\nThe focus of the LASSO regression is to provide the best overall prediction and to reduce the number of variables to identify the predictors of importance not to interpret the meaning of individual predictor coefficients or keep excessive predictors. (Ranstam and Cook 2018).\n\n\n1.2.2 Ridge Regression\nRidge Regression is a regularized regression model that predates LASSO. ((Hastie and Tibshirani 2015)). Again, the need for improving the ordinary least squares comes from the fact that these models have a low bias but large variance. We can trade off some of the large variance by introducing some estimation bias allowing for accuracy of the prediction to improve. The preferred \\(\\lambda\\) in this model is different from the LASSO \\(\\lambda\\) as this ridge parameter reduces the coefficients toward zero without eliminating the the variables completely by reducing coefficients to zero.((Emmert-Streib and Dehmer 2019))\nRidge Regression works best when the ordinary least squares estimates have a high variance and the number of predictors is larger than the number of samples. The benefit of this method is the trade off of reducing the variance by increasing a low bias which can improve the prediction accuracy of the model.((Emmert-Streib and Dehmer 2019))\nThe downfall with this method is the reduction of the coefficients toward zero not to zero. Ridge regression therefore does not provide variable selection as the LASSO method. ((Emmert-Streib and Dehmer 2019))\n\n\n1.2.3 Elastic Net Regularization\nThe elastic net was designed to improve the LASSO method as well as combine the benefits of LASSO and ridge regression. The elastic net has the benefit of LASSO regression as this method can perform variable selection and the benefit of ridge regression since it can be used in cases where the number of predictors is larger than the number of observations. Recall that ridge regression cannot perform variable selection and LASSO cannot manage cases with the number of predictors is much larger than the number of observations.((Emmert-Streib and Dehmer 2019))\nAn issue that can arise from the LASSO is in situations with strongly correlated predictors the variable selection method keeps only the strongest variable. Whereas, the elastic net tends to keep these strongly correlated predictors together in the model with its underlying grouping technique. ((Emmert-Streib and Dehmer 2019))\nThe elastic net is able to blend the methods of LASSO and ridge regression by combining the squared penalty both methods and weighing them based on the number of correlated predictors. ((Hastie and Tibshirani 2015))\nIt does this by including a L2 norm penalty term in addition to the LASSO’s L1 norm penalty term. Similarly to the LASSO, it attempts to improve upon linear regression’s predictive accuracy along with the model’s interpretability in the presence of many predictors. Specifically, elastic net regularization attempts to improve upon LASSO in three scenarios:\n\nThe case where there are more predictors than observations (p > n). In this case, LASSO will predict at most n predictors.\nGrouped variables with high pairwise correlations will cause LASSO to pick only one of the variables.\nIn the case of high multicollinearity in traditional regression scenarios (n < p), LASSO’s performance is weaker than ridge regression. This means that the model does not benefit from LASSO’s feature selection properties.\n\nThe Elastic Net combines qualities from LASSO and Ridge Regression to create a method that deals well with multicollinearity while also employing LASSO-like feature selection. (Zou and Hastie 2005)\n\n\n1.2.4 Comparison: Ridge, LASSO, and Elastic Net\nRidge regression contains the most variables as it does not participate in variable selection. The coefficients go toward zero but are not eliminated. The LASSO model contains the least number of variables as it participates in variable selection including the selection of only one variable in situations where a set of variables exhibit multicollinearity. The Elastic Net model can be weighted to lean more towards the ridge regression eliminating less variables as alpha is set closer to 0 or more towards the LASSO model eliminating more variables with an alpha is closer to 1. This alpha can also be computed using cross-validation.

    "text": "1.3 Why Utilize Regularized Regression Methods?\nRegularized Regression Methods seek generally to improve the Ordinary Least Squares estimates in the regression problem. The two general areas that these methods attempt to improve are prediction accuracy in the model and model interpretability. Prediction accuracy concerns come from Ordinary Least Squares estimates tending to be overfit (having low bias and high variance). Several underlying issues can cause overfitting, including having too many parameters in the model, but the end result is that the model will not have high prediction accuracy.\nTo try and improve the prediction accuracy issue in these sorts of models, the regularization techniques try to alter the parameters (or their coefficients) in order to remove the high variance. This is often done at the expense of bias. The three regularization techniques handle this in different ways:\n\nRidge Regression: As stated above, this method shrinks the coefficients in the model according to a shrinkage penalty term based on the L2 norm and the sum of squared residuals (RSS). The coefficients that have the least influence in the model tend towards 0 the fastest. This reduces their impact on the model and typically lowers the variance, especially when multicollinearity is present.\nLASSO Regression: This method uses a penalty term based on the L1 norm and the RSS to shrink, and even eliminate, coefficients from the model. As coefficients shrink, their impact on the model is reduced, but when a coefficient is dropped completely, the model simplifies further, helping to improve overfitting.\n\nElastic Net Regularization: This is an extension of LASSO where an additional L2 norm penalty term is added to the LASSO. This serves to give LASSO qualities of Ridge regression and helps to improve prediction accuracy by shrinking coefficients and removing unimportant predictors.\n\nThe other main area that regularized regression methods attempt to improve is model interpretability. In this case, the LASSO and Elastic Net Regularization methods improve model interpretability by removing unimportant predictors from the model. This is also called feature selection. A downside of Ridge Regression is that it does not perform feature selection and is unable to improve model interpretability since all predictors remain in the model. In cases where there are high numbers of predictors, Ridge Regression, then, can produce a model that has good predictive ability, but poor interpretability.

    "text": "Previous studies indicate LASSO regression outperforms Ridge regression with sparse data sets in which the variable size is larger than the sample size. Conversely, Ridge regression has been shown to outperform LASSO regression with dense data in which the variable size is smaller than the sample size.(James et al. 2021) The hybrid of the two, Elastic Net regression, will adapt to either type of data by using the properties of LASSO and Ridge regression together. We aim to use two data sets with different characteristics to highlight the advantages of each of the three linear regularization techniques while also using these statistical methods to model the data and make predictions.\n\n\nThe Human Freedom Index from the openintro R package will be used to demonstrate regularization in a high dimensional example where the number of predictors is greater than the number of observations. This data consists of sociological measures of the different types of freedom. The main dataset has 1458 observations with 123 variables, but for this example, a single year of complete observations will be used. This results in a dataset of 93 observations across 99 variables and mimics the situation that would occur if a researcher attempted to analyze the most recent year of this data in isolation from the rest of the dataset.\nAside from year, country, and region identifiers, each column in this data set is a continuous numerical variable. Some variables have high degrees of collinearity because of their relation to one another. For example, total disappearances is expected to have high collinearity with total violent disappearances.\n\n\n\nThe Jackson Heart Study (JHS) data has 198 variables and an n of 2653 for Visit 1 (out of 3). The JHS data will be used to highlight Ridge regression’s performance over LASSO’s when the sample size greatly outnumbers the variable size. Additionally, we are interested in using this data set to test all three methods on shrinking the multicollinearity and to test LASSO’s feature selection capabilities.\n\n\n\n\nJames, Gareth, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibshirani. 2021.

    "text": "The Human Freedom Index uses parameters to determine the personal and economic freedoms of a particular country or jurisdiction. The data used to create the model was trimmed to include the parameters that contained greater than 50% of responses then the countries and jurisdictions with complete observations was utilized. The response variable for the model is the political freedom homicide model. The remaining distinct variables will be used as predictors.\nFirst a linear model was attempted. This model returned an error regarding the degrees of freedom due to the number of predictors in the set. The natural response is the need for a reduction in the number of predictors. The best way to manage a reduction of parameters is the use of regularization models.\nThe three basic regularization models are ridge regression, elastic net, and LASSO. The data was then used to compute the LASSO \\(\\lambda\\) and the ridge regression \\(\\lambda\\). The elastic net uses both \\(\\lambda\\)’s as it is a blend of the two models.\nRidge regression reduces the parameters coefficients but does not eliminate any parameters, LASSO eliminates the most parameters, and the elastic net is a blend of the two. The blending of the elastic net can be determined by the selection of \\(\\alpha\\). Where an \\(\\alpha\\) closer to 0 is more like the ridge regression which retains more parameters and an \\(\\alpha\\) closer to 1 is closer to LASSO which retains less parameters.\nWe created 5 models.\n\n\n\nRegularization Model Type\nNumber of Coefficients\n\n\n\n\nRidge Regression\n98\n\n\nElastic net \\(\\alpha=0.25\\)\n41\n\n\nElastic net \\(\\alpha=0.50\\)\n27\n\n\nElastic net \\(\\alpha=0.75\\)\n13\n\n\nLASSO\n10\n\n\n\nThe data was broken down into an 80/20 split to allow for the creation and testing of the models.

This model needs a little more testing to ensure the model is not overfit to the particular data. This may be an issue due to the low number of observations (\\(n=93\\)). This model did reduce the number of parameters methodically which can allow us to revisit the linear model."

    "text": "We chose the Jackson Heart Study (JHS) dataset to demonstrate multicollinearity and create an environment in which Ridge Regression typically outperforms the LASSO method. When two or more variables are highly collinear, LASSO regression will select one randomly and drop the others to zero. Elastic Net adapts the properties of both LASSO and Ridge, so dropping coefficients is more difficult than LASSO, but can still occur. Whereas, Ridge regression will keep highly collinear variables and adjust their importance with weight. Although this technique introduces more variability in the coefficients and p-values, the prediction of the dependent variable is not affected. Ridge performs well when there are more observations than variables and does well with multicollinearity. Although we started by observing the full JHS Visit 1 dataset of 2653 observations and 198 variables with the correlation matrix, we simplified the final model used for the Regularization Regression methods to exclude non-numeric data and categorical data and to include variables from several “hot spots” from the larger correlation matrix shown below. It is important to note that these regularization regression techniques can be used with other methods such as logistic regression had we decided to analyze the categorical data as well. However, many of the categorical variables were, in fact, composites of or redundant variables to the continuous variables included in this study."

The higher the calculated R2 value, the better the performance of the regression model. Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) is the reciprocal of 1-R2. The typical cutoff for VIF is 5. A VIF score above 5 signifies severe multicollinearity and an increase in variance of the coefficients as a result. This inflation can be a large contributing source of Type II (False Negative) error in linear regression. A VIF < 3 signifies a low correlation. Note the extreme VIF scores for several variables shown here, confirming our suspicions of multicollinearity in the data. The tolerance is the reciprocal of the VIF. It is calculated as 1-R2. Acceptable Tolerance scores are 0.25 and higher.\nTaken together, there is evidence of multicollnearity in the data that could pose a problem with interpretations of linear models. LASSO, Ridge and ElasticNet are most valuable for predictions that are more resistant to the multicollinearity problems that arise with general linear models. Next we will highlight LASSO’s built-in feature selection capabilities and demonstrate Ridge Regression’s ability to outperform LASSO given the right circumstances. The regularized model is more stable with predictions than coefficient and p-values.\nRegularization regression models are best at predictions. so, before we run regularization steps, we need to partition the data for training and testing, and find the optimal lambda in order to train the predictive models. To simplify, we will work with continuous data and variables found in several “hot spots” from the large correlation matrix above.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2.2 LASSO Regression (L1)\n\n\n4.2.3 Finding Optimal Lambda with 10-fold Cross Validation\n\n\n    alpha     lambda\n159     1 0.01466671\n\n\n[1] 0.01466671\n\n\n\n\n\nLASSO Predicts Variable Importance using the sum of decrease in error by each variable. Relative importance is variable importance standardized to the highest valued variable.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that LASSO has dropped 3 variables from the model: height, weight and nbcohesion. It kept variables such as bmi (a composite of height and weight). Eliminating redundant variables demonstrates LASSO’s automatic feature selection properties. These variables had very large VIF and low Tolerance scores, so dropping them from the model will likely not affect the model’s ability to predict ejection fraction.\n\n\n29 x 1 sparse Matrix of class \"dgCMatrix\"\n                            s1\n(Intercept)        62.06311823\nheight              .         \nage                 0.37433590\nweight              .         \nbmi                -0.20621469\nneck                0.55728216\nwaist               0.27193781\nnbcohesion          .         \nnbpctpoverty       -0.41411821\nnbpopdensity1mi     1.48446824\nnbviolence          0.32721465\nnbk3favorfoodstore -0.94216393\nvitamind3epimer    -0.59175868\nrwt                 0.57516426\ndbp                -0.47172460\ncv                 -0.54967558\nqrs                -0.49977220\nsbp                 0.37892530\nqt                  0.37706281\nlvmecho            -1.58162530\nlvmindex            0.83933373\nalbuminuspot       -0.17443143\nfvcpp               0.44543967\nfev1               -0.36674425\nhoma_b             -0.35596479\nhoma_ir             0.05015134\nhba1c              -0.37127668\nfastinginsulin      0.26863477\nfpg                -0.08627352\n\n\n\n\n4.2.4 Ridge Regression (L2)\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that Ridge has preserved all the variables in the model.\n\n\n29 x 1 sparse Matrix of class \"dgCMatrix\"\n                             s1\n(Intercept)        62.063118229\nheight             -0.328942291\nage                 0.367253633\nweight             -0.177554773\nbmi                -0.046283161\nneck                0.509833915\nwaist               0.284977446\nnbcohesion          0.005698985\nnbpctpoverty       -0.391973095\nnbpopdensity1mi     1.165485436\nnbviolence          0.358429644\nnbk3favorfoodstore -0.653056339\nvitamind3epimer    -0.578156859\nrwt                 0.546975215\ndbp                -0.456671077\ncv                 -0.548001203\nqrs                -0.487851438\nsbp                 0.362746921\nqt                  0.365676114\nlvmecho            -0.816777075\nlvmindex            0.156455130\nalbuminuspot       -0.187184851\nfvcpp               0.443247304\nfev1               -0.373001677\nhoma_b             -0.359786953\nhoma_ir             0.073694767\nhba1c              -0.353360710\nfastinginsulin      0.270718173\nfpg                -0.115286297\n\n\nNote that the Elastic Net has dropped only 2 of the same variables as LASSO above.
