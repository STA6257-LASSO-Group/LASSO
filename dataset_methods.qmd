# Methods and Materials

## Data sets

LASSO has been shown to outperform Ridge with sparse data where p\>\>n. Conversely, Ridge has been shown to outperformLASSO with dense data where p \< n. The hybrid of the two, Elastic Net, will adapt to either type of data by using properties of LASSO and Ridge. We aim to use two data sets to highlight the advantages of each of the three regularized linear techniques while also using these statistical methods to model the data and make predictions.

We first want to use a data set that has more features than observations. For this situation, we will use....

This one looks good to me:

## NCI 60 Data test

### Description

NCI microarray data. The data contains expression levels on 6830 genes from 64 cancer cell lines. Cancer type is also recorded.

### Usage

    NCI60

### Format

The format is a list containing two elements: `data` and `labs`.

`data` is a 64 by 6830 matrix of the expression values while `labs` is a vector listing the cancer types for the 64 cell lines.

### Source

The data come from Ross et al. (Nat Genet., 2000). More information can be obtained at http://genome-www.stanford.edu/nci60/

### Examples

    table(NCI60$labs)

The Jackson Heart Study (JHS) data has 198 variables and an n of 2653 for Visit 1 (out of 3). The JHS data will be used to highlight Ridge regression's performance over LASSO when n\>\>p. Additionally, we are interested in this data set to test all three methods on shrinking the multicollinearity and to test LASSO's feature selection capabilities.
