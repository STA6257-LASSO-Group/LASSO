# Methods and Materials

## Data sets

Previous studies indicate LASSO regression outperforms Ridge regression with sparse data sets in which the variable size is larger than the sample size. Conversely, Ridge regression has been shown to outperform LASSO regression with dense data in which the variable size is smaller than the sample size. The hybrid of the two, Elastic Net regression, will adapt to either type of data by using the properties of LASSO and Ridge regression together. We aim to use two data sets with different characteristics to highlight the advantages of each of the three linear regularization techniques while also using these statistical methods to model the data and make predictions.

### NCI 60

Firstly, we want to use a data set that has more features than observations to highlight the LASSO regression's performance. For this situation, we will use the NCI 60 microarray data from Ashburner et al. This data set consists of 6830 genes with cancer types from 64 cancer cell lines. The format of the data set is a list with two elements: `data` and `labs`. The `data` element is a 64 by 6830 matrix of the data values while the `labs` element is a vector of the cancer cell lines listing cancer types.

### Jackson Heart Study

The Jackson Heart Study (JHS) data has 198 variables and an n of 2653 for Visit 1 (out of 3). The JHS data will be used to highlight Ridge regression's performance over LASSO's when the sample size greatly outnumbers the variable size. Additionally, we are interested in using this data set to test all three methods on shrinking the multicollinearity and to test LASSO's feature selection capabilities.
