## Usage Cases for Regularized Regression 

## Feature selection

LASSO, Ridge, and Elastic Net Regression simplify the features by reducing and/or simplifying the values to zero. Due to this type of feature selection and/or reduction, the model may result in poor fitting. ([@Aheto21]) This ill-fitting is mentioned in the previous section on regression line fitting.

Modeling a situation where the number of features is larger than the number of observations is a difficult and unsolved problem in many situations. ([@Laura20])
